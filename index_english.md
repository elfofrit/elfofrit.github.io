# About me

I'm Σlfofrit, I live in Mexico and I studied Physics. I like playing video games, going to the movies, collecting comics and reading science fiction.

I believe in experimenting and getting to know the world to improve as a person, as well as in the healthy intersection of the exact sciences with the fine arts.

Currently, I am looking for a job as a data scientist as I apply for a master's degree in Optical Physics.
