# About me

Hi! Thank you for clicking [elfofrit.com](https://elfofrit.com), my blog.

I am Sebastián, but online, I go by the name Σlfofrit. I am from Mexico and I studied Physics. I like playing video games, going to the movies, collecting comics and reading science fiction.

I believe in getting to know the world to improve as a person, as well as in the healthy intersection of the exact sciences with the fine arts.

Currently, I am looking for a job as a data scientist as I apply for a master's degree in Optical Physics.

I made this blog for two reasons:

1. To get familiar with Julia and build a portfolio that shows my skills in [Data Science](/DataScience_english/) and [Quantum Computing](/QuantumComputing_english/).

2. I like the idea of having a special place in the internet just for me, where I can share whatever I want to whoever is kind enough to read it.

I have used Blogger, Medium and Substack, but I never felt comfortable. I am not interested in cookies, analytics and monetization. This blog and its design is inspired by the site of [Locomalito](https://locomalito.com).

New entries will be announced on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/elfofrit.com). I primarily post in spanish, though.

That's it for this section. Be excellent to each other! Party on, dudes!
